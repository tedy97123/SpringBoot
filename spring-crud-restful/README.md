# SpringBoot
 Springboot CRUD AWS

Java CRUD REST APIs using Spring boot, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL database, deployed the Spring boot project on the AWS cloud.

Spring Boot is often described as a quick and easy way of building production-grade Spring Framework-based applications. To accomplish this, Spring Boot comes prepackaged with auto-configuration modules for most libraries typically used with the Spring Framework. This is often referred to as “convention over configuration.”

AWS Elastic Beanstalk offers a similar approach to application deployment. It provides convention over configuration while still giving you the ability to dig under the hood to make adjustments, as needed. This makes Elastic Beanstalk a perfect match for Spring Boot.
